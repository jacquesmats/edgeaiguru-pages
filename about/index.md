As a researcher and innovation enthusiast, I am passionate about creating new things and learn cutting-edge technology. I've been doing Research & Development since my freshman year in 2010. During my bachelor's degree, I published some papers in local and regional periodicals for 5 years, and I was awarded several scholarships. I had the opportunity to study and work in Germany in 2013 and this experience change my perspective. I learned to improve my German and I realize there were hundreds of new fields to explore and contribute. Once I get back to Brazil, I start thinking about how to improve people's lives and joined a new Research Group to write my Bachelor Thesis, an ultra low power ADC for biological signals.

After my graduation in 2016, I followed my entrepreneurial spirit and opened my own company: Mercateria, it was a grocery delivery startup that taught me a lot. Bringing the entrepreneurship spirit to the company and the FMCG Industry we achieve more than 20 grocery deliveries per day to 483 unique buyers, selling around R$ 155,000.00 in products. Furthermore, we finished between the top 10 most promising startups in the state program StartupRS, initiated with 80 other companies. In 2018 we joined a bigger startup in the delivery ecosystem and I start working with data analytics daily. As Business Intelligence Manager, I was responsible for a team of three people creating insightful reports and dashboards for more than 200 franchises. There I had experience building a Data Science Team e managing data analysis. Using Agile methods and Software Engineer tools, I helped to implement the whole Business Intelligence area. There also, I met and fell in love with Artificial Intelligence. Since then, I've been studying and applying Machine Learning and Deep Learning in several projects. Through some Freelancing projects, I was able to experience multicultural environments and multi timezone projects. I have completed successful projects in the USA, Dubai, Brazil, and Europe.

Last year I joined a Specialization in AI & Robotics from major universities from Brazil on this topic. This opened an opportunity for me to join a Master's Degree in Electrical Engineering, joining an ongoing project to identify energy loss for big energy utilities companies. My Master's Thesis aims to identify crop types and mapping these fields using Deep Learning algorithms. For the past year, I studied concepts and ideas to apply Artificial Intelligence techniques to solve problems and create applications for Earth Observation and Remote Sensing.

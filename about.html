<p>As an entrepreneur and innovation enthusiast, I am passionate about create new things and learn cutting-edge technology. I'm currently working for Delivery Much, as Business Intelligence Team Leader, but my role goes far beyond. I have the opportunity to implement the whole Business Intelligence area in the company. And to make it happen, I'm responsible to define the Data Lake architecture, create the agile processes and delivery a complete BI experience using Metabase and Tableau. As in my last Startup, sometimes I have to change to my developer side, programming in Python and SQL. Right now I'm taking a Machine Learning Nanodegree at Udacity and took part at the PyTorch Scholarship Challenge from Facebook, where I have the opportunity to apply Deep Learning to solve a variety of problems. I'm also familiar with the AWS TI Stack, Data Science and libraries such as pandas, numpy, sklearn and recently, pytorch, tensorflow and keras.</p>

<p>Besides, for the last two years, I have ran my own Startup called Mercateria, a grocery delivery plataform. Where I learned a lot about programming, troubleshooting and how to delegate tasks. I had several functions as a Startup Founder as such marketing issues, financial problems to solve, logistics, presentation to stakeholders/possible investors and even make grocery deliveries. Bringing the entrepreneurship spirit to the company and hands on mindset we achieve more than 20 grocery deliveries per day to 483 unique buyers, selling around R\$ 155,000.00 in products. Furthermore, we finished between the top 10 most promising startups in the state program StartupRS, initiated with 80 other companies.</p>
